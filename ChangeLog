    - Added a Ukrainian translation by Олександр Заяц.
    
    - Added a Galician translation by Roxerio Roxo Carrillo.
    
    - The German translation updated for Comix 4 by Chris Leick.
    
    - Added support for BMP images in archives. Thanks to Nathaniel Moseley.
    
    - The status bar now displays the filename of the viewed image files also
    in archives.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the wrong background colour to be used with the
    dynamic background colour preference on some systems. Thanks to Nathaniel
    Moseley.
    
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the thumbnail maintenance dialog to crash.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the zoom scale in manual zoom mode to be wrong
    when using double page mode.

Comix 4.0.4
    
    - Applied a workaround for a bug that caused the "Open" dialog to crash
    when trying to open a file when the file type filter had been reset to
    blank. This bug seems to only appear on some systems, probably depending
    on the installed GTK+ version.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the error message for unfulfilled dependencies
    to not be printed properly.
    
    - The rar/unrar program is now invoked in such a way as to keep broken
    or incomplete files extracted from RAR archives, since Comix might be
    able to display parts of these files anyway.

Comix 4.0.3
    
    - Hungarian translation updated by Ernő Drabik.
    
    - French translation updated by Benoît H.
    
    - Added a feature to automatically rotate images according to their
    EXIF tags.

    not work properly.
    
    - Fixed some bugs that caused problems with non-UTF-8 filename encodings.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the manual zoom mode to not work as expected
    when set as the default mode.
    
    - Comix now accepts directories as command-line arguments.
    
    - Added command-line arguments to start Comix in fullscreen mode and to
    display the library on startup.
    
    - Comix preferences and data now reside in the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and
    $XDG_DATA_HOME directories instead of in ~/.comix/.
    
    - Some minor interface enhancements.

Comix 4.0.2

    - Brazilian Portuguese translation updated by Marcelo Góes.
    
    - Traditional Chinese translation updated by Wayne Su.
    
    - Catalan translation updated by Carles Escrig Royo.
    
    - Internal filenames in archives created by the archive editing dialog
    no longer contain temporary filename cruft.

Comix 4.0.1

    - Croatian translation updated by Adrian C.
    
    - Polish translation updated by Darek Jakoniuk.
    
    - Russian translation updated by Артем Смирнов.
    
    - Simplified Chinese translation updated by Xie Yanbo.
    
    - Re-added the "flip pages when scrolling off the page" preference
    from previous Comix versions. Thanks to Mamoru Tasaka.
    
    - Added a portability module for handling home directories in a more 
    portable way. Thanks to Oddegamra. 

Comix 4.0.0
    
    - Comix has been completely rewritten from scratch. On the surface things
    look quite a bit like they used to, but the internal workings are 
    entirely new. There are too many changes for them all to be mentioned
    here, but a couple of highlights are a much more functional library and a
    new archive editing dialog. The work on this new version of Comix has
    been going on in rather sporadic phases for almost two years, and during
    that time I have received help from lots of different people. Now, I must
    admit, I can no longer remember them all. So instead of trying to list as
    many as I can here, I will instead simply say thank you to everyone who
    have contributed fixes, patches, suggestions or encouraging words. Thanks!

Comix 3.6.5
    
    - Applied security fix patches to handle unsecure tempfile creation and
    character escaping in filenames. Thanks to Mamoru Tasaka and others for
    the patches.
    
    - Added a Korean translation by 김민기.
    
    - Added a Persian translation by Maryam Sanaat.
    
    - Added a Indonesian translation by Andhika Padmawan.
    
    - Added a Czech translation by Jan Nekvasil.

Comix 3.6.4
    
    - Added a Russian translation by Artyom Smirnov.
    
    - Added a Croatian translation by Adrian C.
    	
    - Fixed a bug in the thumbnailer, comicthumb, failing to create thumbnails
    for Zip and tar archives.
    	    
    - Some minor changes.


Comix 3.6.3
    
    - Added a Hungarian translation by Ernő Drabik.
    
    - Added a patch by Abdullah Hamed that fixes so that the arrow keys can be
    used to flip pages also when not in fit-to-screen mode when the
    corresponding preference is set. Just like was possible only with the
    scroll wheel before.
    
    - Fixed a bug with opening certain Zip files. Thanks to Steve Juranich for
    the fix.
    
    - Fixed a bug concerning %'s in filenames.

Comix 3.6.2
    
    - Added Japanese translation by Mamoru Tasaka.

    - Updated Brazilian Portuguese and Dutch translations.

Comix 3.6

    - Added an "Adjust colour" dialog that lets you specify values for
    brightness, contrast, saturation and sharpness.
    
    - Improved the behaviour of the "Save window position and size" and
    "Default fullscreen" preferences.
    
    - Changed the "Save window position and size" preference to on by default.
    
    - Changed the menus a bit.
    
    - Improved autocontrast (slightly heavier contrast change).
    
    - Changed the UI of the properties dialog a bit to better suit low
    resolution screens.
    
    - Improved handling of Zip files containing files with filenames of an 
    unknown character encoding.
    
    - Added extra error message to install.py that is displayed when trying to
    install into a non-existing directory.
    
    - Added a --no-balloon option to install.py that tells the Nautilus 
    thumbnailer to not imprint balloon images on thumbnails by default.
    
    - Fixed a bug that could cause Comix to scale images to the wrong 
    dimensions on a dual-screen setup. Thanks to Vegard Eriksen for this fix.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused icons to not be loaded when starting Comix
    through a symbolic link not located in the same directory as the `comix`
    executable.
    
    - Fixed a bug that could cause an error message when going back to a
    previous archive by flipping backwards in double page mode and directly
    switching to single page mode afterwards.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused Comix to treat empty files as tar archives.
    Thanks to Christoph Wolk for this fix.

    - Fixed a bug in comicthumb with thumbnailing rar archives, plus
    some cleanup. (Christoph Wolk)

Comix 3.5.1

    - Fixed a bug that caused the mode of all images to be reported as
    "unknown" instead of RGB/CMYK etc.
    
    - Fixed a bug that could cause an error when trying to quit Comix under
    certain circumstances (i.e. when there is no ~/.comix/menu_thumbnails/
    directory present).

Comix 3.5

    - Added a bunch of new icons, including a new "logo".
    
    - The magnifying lens code has been polished a bit. It is now
    substantially faster so the lens should appear less choppy.
    
    - Added horizontal and vertical lossless JPEG flip commands.
    
    - Added a JPEG desaturation command.
    
    - Added support for SVG, PCX, PNM, PBM, PGM, PPM, Targa and Sun raster
    image files.
    
    - Rearranged the toolbar a bit and added tooltips to it.
    
    - When a directory is given as a command line parameter, Comix now
    recursively searches for cbr, cbz and cbt files as well as image files.
    
    - Changed install.py so that it aborts installation if the required
    dependencies are not found.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the space key to not scroll down when in double
    page mode and manga mode and the window is wider than the pages.
    
    - Applied a workaround for a bug(?) in WindowMaker that caused problems
    when using the "fullscreen as default" preference.
    
    - Fixed a memory leak in the magnifying lens code.
    
    - Some internal and some minor changes.

Comix 3.4

    - Added more image data to the properties dialog.
    
    - Added a "delete image" command that can remove single images from Comix.
    It is currently not possible to remove image files within archives.
    
    - Added lossless JPEG rotation commands. It is currently not possible to
    rotate image files within archives. The `jpegtran` program (part of the 
    jpeg library) must be present for this to work. Comix can still run as
    normal without `jpegtran`, but then without the new JPEG rotation
    capabilities.
    
    - Changed the buttons in the toolbar.
    
    - Improved the space key smart scrolling mode so that it automatically
    performs all the sideways scrolling as well.
    
    - Added a preference to set the magnitude of the space key scroll in
    percentages of either the window size or the page size.
    
    - Added a Traditional Chinese translation by Hsin-Lin Cheng.
    
    - Comments are now displayed using a monospaced font.
    
    - Comments can now be dragged around with the mouse just like an image.
    
    - Directories can now be given as command line parameters as well as
    files. If a directory is given it will be recursed into and the first
    image file found will be loaded.
    
    - Improved cover guessing of comicthumb and the library a bit.
    
    - Handling of files that have filenames encoded with the wrong
     character encoding is now more sturdy.
     
     - Fixed a bug that could cause outdated thumbnails to be left in the
     ~/.comix/menu_thumbnails/ directory when running multiple instances of
     Comix at the same time.
     
     - Applied a workaround for a bug(?) in WindowMaker that caused the "Open
     dialog" to be invisible while in fullscreen mode when using WindowMaker.
     The same problem applies to the library window, but there is no
     workaround for that in place currently.
     
     - Fixed a bug that could cause no images to be displayed when turning
     double page mode off, then on again and flipping to the next couple
     of pages in that order.
     
    - Some minor changes.

Comix 3.3

    - Added a slideshow feature.
    	
    - Added RGB colour histogram to the properties dialog. More data will be
    added in future versions.
    
    - Added a Catalan translation by Carles Escrig.		
    
    - Rewrote install.py from scratch.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused compressed tar archives to be presented as
    plain tar archives.
    
    - Fixed a bug that could cause invalid page numbers in bookmarks when
    re-adding an already present bookmark.
    
    - Some minor changes.

Comix 3.2.1

    - Added support for the `rar` program in addition to `unrar` to handle 
    RAR (.cbr) files.
    
    - Updated Polish translation by Kamil Leduchowski.
    
    - Some minor changes.

Comix 3.2

    - Changed PyGTK requirement to version 2.8 or higher.
    
    - Added a "Fit width mode" and a "Fit height mode" that automatically
    scales images to fit the width or height of the window.
    
    - Default filenames for extracted images are changed to 
    <archive_name>_<page>.<ext> from <page>.<ext>.
    
    - Moved the manga mode setting from the preferences dialog to the menus.
    
    - Redesigned the library interface a bit. The background colour is now
    fixed and does not change with the background colour of the main window.
    Default thumbnail size is now 128x128 px, and thumbnails have a border to
    make them more clearly separated. 
    
    - Added Greek translation by Paul Chatzidimitriou.
    
    - Xie Yanbo updated the Simplified Chinese translation.
    
    - Changed the menu icons for "Open library..." and "Add to library". The 
    icons are taken from the Silk Icons set at www.famfamfam.com.
    
    - Broken images are now correctly handled by the thumbnail sidebar.
    
    - The workaround against a problem with unrar applied in version 3.1.3 has
    been removed again. It created some new problems with archives that
    have multiple files with the same filename in different subdirectories.
    
    - Fixed a bug so that translations and extra icons are always available
    when running Comix from the source directory, no matter what directory is 
    the current working directory.
    
    - Fixed a bug in the "Go to page dialog" that caused the page to not be
    changed when manually typing in a new page number and pressing Enter.
    
    - Some minor changes.

Comix 3.1.3

    - Added Polish translation by Kamil Leduchowski.
    
    - Updated French translation by Achraf Cherti.

Comix 3.1.2

    - Fixed a bug which caused ALL files to be added to the library when 
    adding in recursive mode instead of just archives. Also, only files with
    cbz, cbr or cbt as filename extension will now be added in recursive mode
    to avoid adding cruft files with the same magic numbers as the archives.

Comix 3.1.1

    - Added automatic dependency checking to install.py.
    
    - Added error messages and graceful exit from Comix in the case of missing
    dependencies.
    
    - Applied a workaround for a bug(?) in unrar that caused problems with
    some RAR archives containing directories with invalid filename encodings.
    Thanks to François Ingelrest.
    
    - Updated French translation by Achraf Cherti.
    
    - Changed the "Use stored thumbnails for images in archives" preference to
    off by default.
    
    - Changed the "Go to the next archive in directory after last page"
    preference to on by default.

Comix 3.1

    - Created a new convert dialog that is built from the standard GTK+ save
    dialog. It now supports saving in different directories etc.
    
    - Added an "Extract image" menu item that lets you extract individual
    images from the archive.
    
    - Added support for recursive adding of archives to the library.
    
    - Added a Frech translation by Achraf Cherti.
    
    - Fixed a bug which rendered the magnifying lens and the ability to drag
    images around with the mouse useless in some situations, and with some
    certain versions (7.0?) of X.org.
    
    - Pressing enter in the "Go to page" dialog entry now has the same effect
    as pressing OK.
    
    - Applied a workaround for a bug(?) in certain builds of PIL that made
    Comix crash when it tried to draw page numbers on thumbnails. Now Comix
    simply ignores the page numbers if this problem occurs and imforms the
    user that a different version of PIL is required, instead of crashing.

Comix 3.0.1

    - Added a Dutch translation by Arthur Nieuwland.

Comix 3.0

    - Major cleanup of the entire code base.
    
    - Completely redesigned the properties dialog.
    
    - Comix now stores a list of the 10 last viewed files. It also updates the
    ~/.recently-used file as is proposed by the freedesktop.org standard.
    Thanks to Jose M. daLuz.
    
    - Added an "Add to library" menu item.
    
    - Redesigned the library window slightly.
    
    - Added an Italian translation by Raimondo Giammanco.
    
    - The Nautilus thumbnailer, comicthumb, has been updated by Christoph Wolk
    to support subarchives among other things.
    
    - Added a preference to set the size of the magnifying lens. Thanks to 
    Jose M. daLuz.
    
    - Added a scalable svg icon.
    
    - Improved handling of files without read permission. 
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the recommended name for a converted directory
    of images to be the same as one of the image files plus filename extension
    instead of the name of the directory plus filename extension. Thanks to 
    Manuel Quiñones.
    
    - Fixed a bug with the magnifying lens which could appear when using it in
    double page mode and manga mode, possibly showing the images as if not in
    manga mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused unnecessary reloading of files from disk when
    resizing images that is already in memory in double page mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the wrong image to be displayed when 
    continuously flipping forward really fast in cache mode.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.9

    - Added a comic book library feature to Comix. Comic book archives can be
    added to the library through a dialog or by drag and drop. The comic books
    appear as covers in the library window where they can be browsed or
    opened. They can be easily filtered by typing in regular expressions.
    
    - When dropping multiple files on the Comix main window, the first file
    gets opened now instead of none.
    
    - The convert dialog now saves the last used archive type. 
    
    - Fixed a memory leak when creating new thumbnails from files.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.8

    - MIME types for cbz, cbr and cbt archives are now registered by default.
    Use the --no-mime flag for install.py to skip it.
    
    - Added a thumbnailer (by Christoph Wolk) that lets file managers create
    thumbnails for cbz, cbr and cbt archives. Currently it is only supported
    by Nautilus and does not affect other file managers. It is installed if
    the --no-mime flag is not given to install.py. Nautilus has to be
    restarted before the thumbnailer is activated.
    
    - Added a "Hide all" menu item which hides menubar, toolbar, statusbar, 
    scrollbars and thumbnails at once.
    
    - Added an option to only display a single image in double page mode if
    that image consists of two pages. An image is assumed to consist of two
    pages if it's width is greater than it's height.
    
    - Filename is now displayed as well as directory name when viewing images
    in a directory in single page mode.
    
    - Changed max zoom to 1000% to prevent X server resource drains.
    
    - F11 can now be used to toggle fullscreen mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the cursor to be invisible when dragging around
    an image in fullscreen mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which removed the drag and drop functionality.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the scroll wheel to stop working when
    displaying the magnifying lens by pressing the middle mouse button,
    holding down the right mouse button and letting go the middle mouse button
    again.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the chess board pattern background for
    small transparent images to be zoomed in or out when changing size.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause changes of saturation in small images to
    not be updated when changing it and changing it back again.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the images to be scaled incorrectly when
    the "Use smart scaling in double page mode" preference was set.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the thumb selection not to be updated when
    moving from page two to page one in double page mode.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.7

    - Improved image quality through dithering in 16 bits per pixel. Thanks to
    John Ellis, the author of GQview, for helping me with this.
    
    - Added previews of files in the "Open" dialog. Stored thumbnails are used
    when they exist, otherwise previews are created directly from the files.
    Previews of archives are also available, but only when thumbnails have
    already been stored for that archive.
    
    - The cursor is now only being hidden when it has been idle for two
    seconds instead of always.
    
    - Changed "Hide cursor in fullscreen mode" to on by default.
    
    - Added chess board pattern as background for transparent images.
    
    - Added file filters to the "Open" dialog.
    
    - Saturation adjustment now affects the magnifying lens also.
    
    - Added Brazilian Portuguese translation by Marcelo Góes.
    
    - Added German translation by Christoph Wolk.
    
    - Added a "comix.xml" file which can be installed to register cbz, cbr and
    cbt mime types. Because of inconsistency on some systems, mime types are
    not registered by default. Follow the instructions in the mime README file
    to install. Thanks to Cristoph Wolk for this contribution.
    
    - Changed permissions of temporary folders to octal 700 to preserve the
    users privacy.
    
    - Added page number information to thumbnails generated for archives. This
    information will displayed for previews of archives if available.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the image width and height information embedded
    in thumbnails to be put in the wrong namespace of the PNG tEXt chunks.
    
    - Fixed possible wrong permissions of thumbnail folders on some systems.
    Permissions should now always be 700.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the magnifying lens to display the wrong page
    in manga mode (thanks Christoph Wolk).
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause Comix to crash when trying to view a very
    small image scaled down so that it contained no pixels at all.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.6

    - Comix now conforms to the thumbnail managing standard as proposed by
    freedesktop.org. Thumbnails for plain image files can be read and written
    to ~/.thumbnails where they are shared with other applications conforming
    to the same standard. Thumbnails for images in archives can also be
    stored, but due to limitations in the standard they are stored in ~/.comix
    for private use by Comix only.
    
    - Improved handling of corrupt and missing files. Comix now simply
    displays a "file missing" image instead of terminating.
    
    - Added a menu entry for the lens toggle action.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.5

    - Added a mouse controlled "magnification lens" that can be used to zoom
    in on parts of the images. It will appear while holding the middle mouse
    button. Pressing 'z' can also toggle it on or off.
    
    - Added the ability to set the size of the thumbnails.
    
    - Improved the look of the bookmark handling features. Small thumbnails
    will now be displayed for the bookmarks.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused one of the two images in double page mode to
    remain displayed even after using the "Close" command.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the "Use smart scaling in double page mode"
    preference to misbehave with rotated images.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the convert dialog to not automatically fill in
    a new filename for files with non-UTF8 filenames.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.4.1

    - Improved cache handling slightly.
    
    - FIxed a bug which could cause Comix to crash when starting with the
    "Save window position and size for future sessions" option turned on.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused only one thumbnail to remain selected when 
    clicking on the first of the two selected thumbnails in double page mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused Comix to always go to the first page when
    reloading thumbnails in double page mode due to switching the "Show page
    numbers on thumbnails" on or off.

Comix 2.4

    - Added full support for internationalization (i18n). Apart from English,
    Comix is now translated to Swedish, Simplified Chinese and Spanish.
    
    - Added an option to let Comix automatically adjust the contrast of the
    images so that the darkest pixel is completely black and the lightest
    pixel is completely white.
    
    - Added an option to space key "smart scrolling" feature as if in double
    page mode even when in single page mode.
    
    - Added thin borders around the thumbnails so that they should be more 
    easily distinguished.
    
    - Added accelerators for more menu items.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the wrong image to be displayed when viewing
    the third last and the second last pages in double page mode, exiting
    double page mode and flipping forward one page.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused Comix to display no warning when trying to
    create a file in a directory where it does not have permission to do so.

Comix 2.3

    - Comix now depends on the Python Imaging Library 
    (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) to handle some image 
    manipulations.
    
    - Added the ability to rotate and mirror images.
    
    - Added an option to set the contrast of the images.
    
    - Added an option to show the page numbers in the upper left corner of
    each thumbnail.
    
    - Cleaned up the preferences dialog a bit.
    
    - The arrow keys now flips pages in fit-to-screen mode.
    
    - Added an option to go to the same directory as last time when opening
    the "Open" dialog, instead of always going to a preset directory.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused comments to not be displayed until after all
    thumbnails had been loaded when using the "Always view comments when
    opening a new file" option.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused comment files in a directory, had their 
    extensions been added to the comment extensions list while the directory
    was loaded, to not be opened correctly until the directory had been
    reloaded.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the scrollbars to not align themselves 
    automatically when switching between viewing comments and viewing images.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the "Fit width", "Fit height" and "Best fit"
    commands to scale incorrectly when viewing thumbnails.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the wrong image to be displayed if
    switching from one page to another and back again really quickly.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.2.1

    - Fixed a bug which caused underscores in bookmark names to be shown 
    as underlines for the next character.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused Comix to crash when trying to close the 
    program while loading thumbnails for an archive/directory that was 
    opened while loading thumbnails for the same archive/directory.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused some events (e.g. switching fullscreen on/off),
    invoked while loading thumbnails, to be delayed until all the thumbnails
    had been loaded if they were invoked more than once during this loading.
    There are still some issues with events that in themself initiate the
    loading of thumbnails (e.g. open new file) being delayed if invoked
    multiple times during the loading. This should, however, not be a problem
    in most cases.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused some thumbnails to not be displayed in whole
    when using certain GTK themes.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the selected thumbnails to not be updated
    properly when switching between single page and double page mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the thumbnail scrollbar to not update it's
    length when resizing the main window.
    
    - Made the automatic scrolling of the thumbnail pane more consequent
    in double page mode.

Comix 2.2

    - Added a thumbnail browser.
    
    - Added a "smart scrolling" option for the space key. 
    
    - The number pad on the keyboard can now be used to align the image(s). 
    '1' takes you to the lower left corner, '2' takes you to the middle of the
    bottom, '3' takes you to the lower right corner and so on for all nine
    digits.
    
    - Added an option to automatically open the last viewed page when Comix
    is started.
    
    - The zoom in and zoom out commands now zoom straight on, preserving
    the alignment of the viewed image(s).
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused images to be scaled slighty wrong during
    specific window size/image size combinations.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the wrong image to be displayed when jumping
    two pages forward with the cache option turned on in single page mode.

Comix 2.1

    - Made the dialogs more GNOME HIG compliant.
    
    - Added an option to let the scroll wheel scroll horizontally when at the 
    top or bottom of the page.
    
    - Added an option to let the scroll wheel flip pages when scrolling "off 
    the page".
    
    - Added an option to use smart scaling when in double page mode and
    fit-to-screen mode. The smart scaling feature makes the images scale
    independently so that no space is wasted. The largest of the images is 
    scaled as before, but the smallest in now scaled up to fill any extra
    space.
    
    - Added an option to set the toolbar to show either icons, text or both.
    
    - The image can now be dragged around with the middle mouse button
    as well.
    
    - If adding a bookmark for an archive/directory that is already 
    bookmarked, Comix now updates the page number of that bookmark
    instead of adding a new one.
    
    - Added tooltips for the preferences dialog.
    
    - Removed the zoom entry in the preferences dialog.
    
    - Made the cleanup of files in /tmp a bit more sturdy.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the scrollbars to not align themselves 
    automatically when opening a new archive/folder.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused changes to fullscreen, fit-to-screen mode etc. 
    that were made while the preferences dialog was open to be reverted when 
    the dialog was closed.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused some images to appear twice if they were 
    packed in an archive containing multiple subfolders.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused some strange behaviour when (un)hiding the
    menubar after a bookmark had been added/removed.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.0

    - The text in the comments is now selectable.
    
    - Some minor (mainly cosmetic) changes.

Comix 2.0b

    - Comix 2.0b has a major speed advantage over previous versions.
    I rewrote some of the code, mainly the parts concerning the caching of 
    images. Page flipping with the cache option turned off is now about 
    twice as fast as before (not counting the time it takes to scale the 
    image(s) since this is highly dependant on the image scaling quality being 
    used). Forward page flipping with the cache option turned on now seems
    almost instantaneous (again not counting the possible delay to scale 
    the image(s)). Backwards flipping with the cache option turned on is no 
    longer suffering any speed penalty, it is just as fast as normal flipping
    without any cache would be. The only occasion when things will be slower
    with the cache option turned on is when doing irregular flipping, as from 
    page 1 to page 7 to page 3 etc., and even then things will seem to be 
    as fast as normal though some extra work is done "under the hood". 
    Using cache is strongly recommended from now on.
    
    - Added a bookmarks manager that lets you add or remove single bookmarks. 
    
    - Added support for image/x-icon, image/x-xpixmap and image/x-xbitmap 
    image formats.
    
    - Changed the text entry field for the default path to a button which
    brings up a nice standard folder selection dialog.
    
    - The "Flip position of pages in double page mode" option, now called 
    "Manga mode", automatically aligns the scrollbars to the upper-right
    corner of the window when flipping to a new page.
    
    - The "Hide menubar etc. in fullscreen" option now also affects the 
    scrollbars.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused temporary files to be overwritten when viewing
    two archives in two different Comix sessions at the same time.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the separators in the menus to disappear after 
    a while.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the wrong page to be displayed when flipping 
    backwards one step in double page mode, switching to one page mode, 
    switching back to double page mode again and then flipping forward one 
    step, all with the cache option set.
    
    - Lots of minor fixes.

Comix 1.6

    - The next page can now be flipped to by pressing the left mouse button
    on the main window. Images can still be moved around by clicking and 
    dragging before you release the button again.
    
    - The "Hide cursor" option now only affect fullscreen.
    
    - Comix now sorts files by the standard set up by the LC_COLLATE
    environmental variable.
    
    - Added a new dialog to display an error message if the convert utility
    is used in some way to alter a file which the user does not have 
    appropriate permissions to.
    
    - Fixed a bug with the wrong filename sometimes being shown in the 
    properties dialog when viewing plain image files.
    
    - Fixed a bug with strange things happening when opening the
    preferences window in windowed mode and closing it in fullscreen mode
    and vice versa.
    
    - Fixed a bug with the "Hide menubar etc. in fullscreen" option not
    always working as expected.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.5

    - Added support for forward/back buttons on mice that have them.
    Thanks to Stephen Jones for this feature.
    
    - New option to set which filename extensions should be treated as 
    comment files.
    
    - New option to automatically hide menubar etc. when entering 
    fullscreen mode.
    
    - Improved the look of the properties dialog.
    
    - Fixed problems with parsing certain comment files.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.4

    - Added support for embedded archive comments in the form of .txt or 
    .nfo files.
    
    - The convert utility now creates exact copies of the directory structure
    in the source archive/directory, including correct filenames.
    
    - The zoom in and zoom out commands now zoom 15% relative to the
    current size instead of 20% relative to the original size.
    
    - Changed default image scaling quality to "Tiles" from "Hyper".
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.3.1

    - Fixed a bug with old cached images sometimes being shown when a new
    archive/directory had been opened.

Comix 1.3

    - The viewed page(s) can now be dragged around by pressing the mouse
    button and moving the cursor.
    
    - New option to cache the next page for faster forward page flipping.
    Continuous backwards flipping will be slower with this option. Slightly
    more RAM will be used as well.
    
    - Comix now handles manipulation of already loaded images (resizing, 
    changing scaling technique, etc.) more efficiently due to less disk IO.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused saved options to not be loaded when the 
    program is restarted.

Comix 1.2
    
    - Drag and drop support.
    
    - Changed the install.py script slightly.
    
    - Added new error messages for the statusbar when trying to open 
    non-valid files etc.

Comix 1.1.2

    - Applied a workaround for a bug(?) in newer versions of PyGTK, which made
    the OK button in the file selection dialog return the wrong value,
    rendering it useless. Thanks to neota for this solution.

Comix 1.1.1

    - The "file" dependancy is no longer needed. All mime type checks are now
    done internally.
    
    - Fixed an error in the .desktop file. 
    
    - The install.py script now uses "update-desktop-database" to update the 
    menus properly.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.1

    - Support for nestled archives, i.e. archives in archives.
    
    - The install.py script now includes a "--installdir" option to let the
    user choose the install directory, e.g. /usr instead of /usr/local.
    
    - Comix now includes a manpage.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.0.2

    - Added support for filenames encoded with various international 
    character encodings.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.0.1

    - Fixed a bug with the background colour option not working as expected
    on certain systems.

Comix 1.0

    - Added an archive convert feature. Archives and directories can be
    converted to Zip, tar, tar.gz or tar.bz2.
    
    - More changes toward a hopefully more user-friendly GUI.

Comix 0.9

    - A number of efforts has been made to make Comix more GNOME HIG 
    compliant.
    
    - Added optional menubar, toolbar and statusbar.
    
    - Added an option to hide the mouse cursor.
    
    - The space key now works in fit to screen mode as well.
    
    - Fixed a bug with certain hotkeys not working before the right-click menu
    had been shown the first time.
    
    - Fixed a bug with archive names sometimes being displayed incorrectly in
    the bookmarks menu.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 0.8

    - Comix now handles zip, tar, tar.gz and tar.bz2 archives 
    internally. The unzip and tar programs are no longer needed.
    
    - New option to let you go to the next archive when flipping past the 
    last page in the current archive, and vice versa for the first page.
    
    - Fixed a bug with small images sometimes being stretched to
    fit the screen although the corresponding option was not set.
    
    - Fixed a bug with exiting fullscreen mode with the escape key.
    
    - Supported image formats are now "only" JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF and BMP.
    There were problems with other files being reported as image files though
    they were not.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 0.7

    - Added a new "bookmark" feature.
    
    - Now reads any image format supported by gtk.gdk.Pixbuf (that
    means most formats).
    
    - Fixed a bug with capital letters not working as hotkeys.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 0.6

    - Added a new option to hide the scrollbars even when not in fit to
    screen mode.
    
    - Pressing space now scrolls the page to show the next part of it, if 
    pressed at the bottom of the page it flips to the next page.
    
    - Dialogs should now look better and use buttons with stock icons.
    
    - Scrolling could be a bit faulty due to different dimensions of the
    scrollbars in different themes. That problem is now fixed.
    
    - `Fit width', `Fit height' and `Fit to screen' commands should now be 
    exact.

Comix 0.5.2

    - The makefile in 0.5.1 could in some cases change the permissions
    of the folders Comix were installed in to 0755. To solve this 
    vulnerability Comix 0.5.2 uses a python script `install.py' to install 
    the program instead.
    
    Usage of the 0.5.1 makefile is not recommended!

Comix 0.5.1

    - Fixed a problem with the makefile. Destination directories will now
    be created if they do not already exist.

Comix 0.5

    - Fixed a bug with the background colour option not working.
    
    - Added a colour picking dialog instead of the old entry box for the
    background colour.

    - Added `Fit width', `Fit height' and `Fit to screen' commands to the
    right-click menu.
    
    - Added new option to save zooming values to future sessions.
    
    - The right-click menu and the preferences window now looks better
    and should hopefully be more user friendly.
    
    - Changed some hotkeys and their effect.
    
    - PyGTK requirement is now 2.6+.

Comix 0.4

    - Comix now supports image zooming and window scrolling as well
    as the old fit-to-screen-mode.
    
    - Comix now includes a makefile, a .desktop file and an icon for an 
    easy installation and desktop integration.

    - New option to save window position and size to future sessions.
    
    - New option to set a default path to open when selecting a new file
    with the `Open file' command.
    
    - Comix now supports page scrolling with the mouse wheel.
    
    - Fixed a bug with trying to view `File info' when viewing the last page
    in double page mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug with the number of pages always reported as zero in the
    go-to-page-window.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 0.2.1

    - Fixed a bug with opening archives with 3+ files with the same name.

Comix 0.2

    - Now uses the shutil module to move and delete files instead
    of calling the `rm' and `mv' programs.
    
    - Now uses gtk.gdk.pixbuf_get_file_info() to check image file types
    and the `file' program to check filetypes for ZIP/RAR archives.
    Filename extensions should no longer matter for Comix.
    
    - Now supports tar, tar.gz and tar.bz2 archives.
    
    - New menu option `File info' brings up a window and displays various
    information about the file being viewed.
    
    - New option to flip the pages viewed in double page mode.
    
    - New option to reverse the reading order (start with the last page).
    
    - New option to set the saturation of the images displayed.
    
    - Some minor fixes.
    
    - New dependencies are `file' and `tar' (should be installed on most 
    systems as default).
