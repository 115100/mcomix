  <p>
	  MComix is an user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically
	  designed to handle comic books, but also serves as a generic viewer.
	  It reads images in various archive formats such as ZIP, RAR, 7Zip, LHA or
	  tar/gz/bz2, archives as well as plain image files.
  </p>
  <p>
	  MComix is a fork of the Comix project, and aims to add bug fixes and
	  stability improvements after Comix development came to a halt in
	  late 2009.
